# Juice Bomber [ order prioritizor ]

## Problem Statement

```sh
Problem with scaling existing juice shops is the fact that juice makers ( chefs ) do not follow a standard way to prioratize which order to take up first. perhaps... there is a better way.

I would want to introduce a system that computes the best order of preperation and serve of the requested list of juice orders
things to consider are,
- Number of Mixers
- Number of Chefs ( How many juices are prepared at once ?)
- Inventory of Fruits in Real time

Features of the application
- color coded ( or images of fruits ) with count in realtime
- calculate if the inventory of ingredients hasn't exhausted before accepting the order
